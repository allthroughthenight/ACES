		located in 'app'/views/generic.html
		looking at code, looks like only shown when ip is set to local host, so don't adjust unless visibile in actual production

use 'octave beta_rayleigh.m' as test function

able to call function, but not correct formatting


make 'global' menu
	main options are function areas
	function ares drop downs are there respective application name
	taken from 'aces/aces/docs/aces.html'

application 'template'
	title of application
	input fields
	take input, pass to octave, print output
	history of past computations (session states?)

modules to check out
	matplotlib.org
	plot.ly/python
	pypi.python.org/pypi/oct2py

redux
"web-based ipython notebook. There, detailed tutorial information, such as inputs, outputs, code execution, and code comments can be included"

ramblings
* check 'OTHER' variable, 'ft2m' constant, and if all input should just be metric
	find which .m files graphing isn't working, or doesn't work at all
	put all functions on home page page
	double check fortran app for input style
	have input along side output
	how to format octave out for web2py
