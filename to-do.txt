use 'octave beta_rayleigh.m' as test function
able to call function, but not correct formatting

about '[design] [request] [responwse] [session] [db tables] [db stats]' menu
	located in 'app'/views/generic.html
	looking at code, looks like only shown when ip is set to local host, so don't adjust unless visibile in actual production
make 'global' menu
	main options are function areas
	function ares drop downs are there respective application name
	taken from 'aces/aces/docs/aces.html'
