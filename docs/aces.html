                                    PURPOSE

     This note discusses a microcomputer-based software package that contains
reliable state-of-the-art solutions to various coastal engineering problems.

                                   BACKGROUND

     In 1986 the Coastal Engineering Research Center (CERC) recommended to the
Office, Chief of Engineers that an Automated Coastal Engineering System (ACES)
be developed to give Corps offices an interactive computer based design
capability in the field of coastal engineering. The recommendation was in
response to a charge by the Chief of Engineers, LTG E. R. Heiberg III, to the
Coastal Engineering Research Board to provide improved design capabilities to
Corps coastal specialists.

     CERC formed an internal technical committee to develop recommendations for
implementing an automated design System. This committee obtained input from
Corps field offices regarding the form and development procedures preferred for
the system. The information was obtained primarily from six regional workshops
conducted in July 1986 and attended by more than one hundred coastal
specialists.

     Based on recommendations from the workshops, a Pilot Committee composed
primarily of Corps District and Division coastal specialists was formed in
September 1986 to guide development of the ACES. In addition an Automated
Coastal Engineering Group was formed in February 1987 within CERC to implement
its development.

                                  INTRODUCTION

     The ACES is a microcomputer-based design and analysis system in the field
of coastal engineering. The contents range from simple algebraic expressions
both theoretical and empirical in origin, to numerically intense algorithms
spawned by the increasing power and affordability of computers. The methods in
the ACES range from classical theory describing wave motion, to expressions
resulting from tests with structures in wave flumes, and to recent numerical
models describing the exchange of energy from the atmosphere to the sea
surface.

                                 ACES CONTENTS

     The various methodologies included in ACES are called applications, and
are organized into categories called functional areas differentiated according
to general relevant physical processes and design or analysis activities. A
summary of the applications currently resident in the ACES is given in Table 1.

                        DESCRIPTION OF ACES APPLICATIONS

     The various applications within the functional areas represent a number of
different methodologies of varying complexity. A brief description of each
application follows.

   WAVE PREDICTION FUNCTIONAL AREA

     Windspeed Adjustment and Wave Growth

          The methodologies represented in this ACES application provide quick
          and simple estimates for wave growth over open-water and restricted
          fetches in deep and shallow water.  Also, improved methods (over
          those given in the Shore Protection Manual (SPM), 1984) are included
          for adjusting the observed winds to those required by wave growth
          formulas.

     Beta-Rayleigh Distribution

          This application provides a statistical representation for a shallow
          water wave height distribution.  The Beta-Rayleigh distribution is
          expressed in familiar wave parameters: Hmo (energy based wave 
          height), Tp (peak spectral wave period), and d(water depth).  After 
          constructing the distribution, other statistically based wave height
          estimates such as Hrms, Hmean, H1/10 can be easily computed.  The 
          Beta-Rayleigh distribution features a finite upper bound 
          corresponding to the breaking wave height, and the expression 
          collapses to the Rayleigh distribution in the deepwater limit.  The 
          methodology for this portion of the application is taken exclusively
          from Hughes and Borgman (1987).

     Extremal Significant Wave Height Analysis

          This application provides significant wave height estimates for
          various return periods.  Confidence intervals are also provided.  The
          approach developed by Goda (1988) is used to fit five candidate
          probability distributions to an input array of extreme significant
          wave heights.  Candidate distribution functions are Fisher-Tippett
          Type I and Weibull with exponents ranging from 0.75 to 2.0.
          Goodness-of-fit information is provided for identifying the
          distributions which best match the input data.

     Constituent Tide Record Generation

          This application predicts a tide elevation record at a specific time
          and locale using known amplitudes and epochs for individual harmonic
          constituents.

   WAVE THEORY FUNCTIONAL AREA

     Linear Wave Theory

          This application yields first-order approximations for various
          parameters of wave motion as predicted by the wave theory bearing the
          same name (also known as small amplitude, sinusoidal, or Airy
          theory).  It provides estimates for engineering quantities such as
          water surface elevation, general wave properties, particle
          kinematics, and pressure as functions of wave height and period,
          water depth, and position in the waveform.

     Cnoidal Wave Theory

          This application yields various parameters of wave motion as
          predicted by first-order (Isobe, 1985) and second-order (Hardy and
          Kraus, 1987) approximations for cnoidal wave theory.  It provides
          estimates for common items of interest such as water surface
          elevation, general wave properties, kinematics, and pressure as
          functions of wave height and period, water depth, and position in the
          waveform.

     Fourier Series Wave Theory

          This application yields various parameters for progressive waves of
          permanent form, as predicted by Fourier series approximation.  It
          provides estimates for common engineering parameters such as water
          surface elevation, integral wave properties, and kinematics as
          functions of wave height, period, water depth, and position in the
          wave form which is assumed to exist on a uniform co-flowing current.
          Stokes first and second approximations for celerity (i.e., values of
          the mean Eulerian current or mean mass transport rate) may be
          specified.  Fourier series of up to 25 terms may be selected to
          approximate the wave.

   WAVE TRANSFORMATION FUNCTIONAL AREA

     Linear Wave Theory with Snell's Law

          This application provides a simple estimate for wave shoaling and
          refraction using Snell's law with wave properties predicted by linear
          wave theory.  Given wave properties and a crest angle at a known
          depth, it predicts the values in deep water and at a subject location
          specified by a new water depth. An important assumption for this
          application is that all depth contours are assumed to be straight and
          parallel.  The criteria of Singamsetti and Wind (1980) and Weggel
          (1972) are employed to provide an estimate for breaker parameters.

     Irregular Wave Transformation (Goda's method)

          This application yields cumulative probability distributions of wave
          heights as a field of irregular waves propagate from deep water
          through the surf zone.  The application is based on two random-wave
          theories by Yoshimi Goda (1975 and 1984).  The 1975 paper concerns
          transformation of random waves shoaling over a plane bottom with
          straight parallel contours.  This analysis treated breaking and
          broken waves and resulted in cumulative probability distributions for
          wave heights given a water depth.  It did not include refraction,
          however.  The 1984 article details a refraction procedure for random
          waves propagating over a plane bottom with straight parallel contours
          assuming a particular incident spectrum.  This ACES application
          combines the two approaches by treating directional random waves
          propagating over a plane bottom with straight parallel contours.
          This application also uses the theory of Shuto (1974) for the
          shoaling calculation.  The theories assume a Rayleigh distribution of
          wave heights in the nearshore zone and a Bretschneider-Mitsuyasu
          incident directional spectrum.  The processes modeled include: Wave
          refraction, Wave shoaling, Wave breaking, Wave setup, and Surf beat.

     Combined Diffraction and Reflection by a Vertical Wedge

          This application estimates wave height modification due to combined
          diffraction and reflection near jettied harbor entrances, quay walls,
          and other such structures.  Jetties and breakwaters are approximated
          as a single straight, semi-infinite breakwater by setting the wedge
          angle to zero.  Corners of docks and quay walls may be represented by
          setting the wedge angle equal to 90 degrees.  Additionally, such
          natural diffracting and reflecting obstacles as rocky headlands can
          be approximated by setting a particular value for the wedge angle.

   STRUCTURAL DESIGN FUNCTIONAL AREA

     Breakwater Design Using Hudson and Related Equations

          A rubble structure is often composed of several layers of
          random-shaped or random-placed stones, protected with a cover layer
          of selected armor units of either quarrystone or specially shaped
          concrete units.  This ACES application provides estimates for the
          armor weight, minimum crest width, armor thickness, and the number of
          armor units per unit area of a breakwater using Hudson's and related
          equations.  The material presented herein can be found in Chapter 7
          of the SPM (1984).

     Toe Protection Design

          Toe protection consists of armor for the beach or bottom material
          fronting a structure to prevent wave scour.  This application
          determines armor stone size and width of a toe protection apron for
          vertical faced structures such as seawalls, bulkheads, quay walls,
          breakwaters, and groins.  Apron width is determined by the
          geotechnical and hydraulic guidelines specified in Engineer Manual
          1110-2-1614.  Stone size is determined by a method (Tanimoto, Yagyu,
          and Goda, 1982) whereby a stability equation is applied to a single
          rubble unit placed at a position equal to the width of the toe apron
          and subjected to standing waves.

     Nonbreaking Wave Forces on Vertical Walls

          This application provides the pressure distribution and resultant
          force and moment loading on a vertical wall caused by
          normally-incident, nonbreaking, regular waves.  The results can be
          used to design vertical structures in protected or fetch-limited
          regions when the water depth at the structure is greater than about
          1.5 times the maximum expected wave height.  The application provides
          the same results as found using the design curves given in Chapter 7
          of the SPM (1984).

     Rubble-Mound Revetment Design

          Quarrystone is the most commonly used material for protecting earth
          embankments from wave attack because, where high-quality stone is
          available, it provides a stable and unusually durable revetment armor
          material at relatively low cost.  This ACES application provides
          estimates for revetment armor and bedding layer stone sizes,
          thicknesses, and gradation characteristics.  Also calculated are two
          values of runup on the revetment, an expected extreme, and a
          conservative runup value.

   WAVE RUNUP, TRANSMISSION, AND OVERTOPPING FUNCTIONAL AREA

     Irregular Wave Runup on Beaches

          This application provides an approach to calculate runup statistical
          parameters for wave runup on smooth slope linear beaches.  To account
          for permeable and rough slope natural beaches, the present approach
          needs to be modified by multiplying the results for the smooth slope
          linear beaches by a reduction factor.  However, there is no guidance
          for such a reduction due to the sparsity of good field data on wave
          runup.  The approach used in this ACES application is based on
          existing laboratory data on irregular wave runup (Mase and Iwagaki,
          1984 and Mase, 1989).

     Wave Runup and Overtopping on Impermeable Structures

          This application provides estimates of wave runup and overtopping on
          rough and smooth slope structures that are assumed to be
          impermeable.  Run-up heights and overtopping rates are estimated
          independently or jointly for monochromatic or irregular waves
          specified at the toe of the structure.  The empirical equations
          suggested by Ahrens and McCartney (1975), Ahrens and Titus (1985),
          and Ahrens and Burke (1987) are used to predict runup, and Weggel
          (1976) to predict overtopping.  Irregular waves are represented by a
          significant wave height and are assumed to conform to a Rayleigh
          distribution (Ahrens, 1977).  The overtopping rate is estimated by
          summing the overtopping contributions from individual runups in the
          distribution.

     Wave Transmission on Impermeable Structures

          This application provides estimates of wave runup and transmission on
          rough and smooth slope structures.  It also addresses wave
          transmission over impermeable vertical walls and composite
          structures.  In all cases, monochromatic waves are specified at the
          toe of a structure that is assumed to be impermeable.  For sloped
          structures, a method suggested by Ahrens and Titus (1985) and Ahrens
          and Burke (1987) is used to predict runup, while the method of Cross
          and Sollitt (1971) as modified by Seelig (1980) is used to predict
          overtopping. For vertical wall and composite structures, a method
          proposed by Goda, Takeda, and Moriya (1967) and Goda (1969) is used
          to predict wave transmission.

     Wave Transmission Through Permeable Structures

          Porous rubble-mound structures consisting of quarry stones of various
          sizes often offer an attractive solution to the problem of protecting
          a harbor against wave action.  It is important to assess the
          effectiveness of a given breakwater design by predicting the amount
          of wave energy transmitted by the structure.  This application
          determines wave transmission coefficients and transmitted wave
          heights for permeable breakwaters with crest elevations at or above
          the still-water level.  This application can be used with breakwaters
          armored with stone or artificial armor units.  The application uses a
          method developed for predicting wave transmission by overtopping
          coefficients using the ratio of breakwater freeboard to wave runup
          (suggested by Cross and Sollitt, 1971).  The wave transmission by
          overtopping prediction method is then combined with the model of wave
          reflection and wave transmission through permeable structures of
          Madsen and White (1976).  Seelig (1979,1980) had developed a similar
          version for mainframe processors.

   LITTORAL PROCESSES FUNCTIONAL AREA

     Longshore Sediment Transport

          This application provides estimates of the potential longshore
          transport rate under the action of waves.  The method used is based
          on the empirical relationship between the Longshore component of wave
          energy flux entering the surf zone and the immersed weight of sand
          moved (Galvin, 1979).  Two methods are available to the user
          depending on whether available input data are breaker wave height and
          direction or deepwater wave height and direction.

     Numerical Simulation of Time-Dependent Beach and Dune Erosion

          This application is a numerical beach and dune erosion model that
          predicts the evolution of an equilibrium beach profile from
          variations in water level and breaking wave height as occur during a
          storm.  The model is one-dimensional (only onshore-offshore sediment
          transport is represented).  It is based on the theory that an
          equilibrium profile results from uniform wave energy dissipation per
          unit volume of water in the surf zone.  The general characteristics
          of the model are based on a model described by Kriebel (1982, 1984a,
          1984b, 1986).  Because of the complexity of this methodology and the
          input requirements, familiarization with the above references is
          strongly recommended.

     Calculation of Composite Grain-Size Distributions

          The major concern in the design of a sediment sampling plan for
          beach-fill purposes is determining the composite grain size
          characteristics of both the native beach and the potential borrow
          site.  This application calculates a composite grain size
          distribution that reflects textural variability of the samples
          collected at the native beach or the potential borrow area.

     Beach Nourishment Overfill Ratio and Volume

          The methodologies represented in this ACES application provide two
          approaches to the planning and design of nourishment projects.  The
          first approach is the calculation of the overfill ratio, which is
          defined as the volume of actual borrow material required to produce a
          unit volume of usable fill.  The second approach is the calculation
          of a renourishment factor which is germane to the long-term
          maintenance of a project, and addresses the basic question of how
          often renourishment will be required if a particular borrow source is
          selected that is texturally different from the native beach sand.

   INLET PROCESSES FUNCTIONAL AREA

     A Spatially Integrated Numerical Model for Inlet Hydraulics

          This application is a numerical model that estimates coastal inlet
          velocities, discharges, and bay levels as functions of time for a
          given time-dependent sea level fluctuation.  Inlet hydraulics are
          predicted in this model by simultaneously solving the time-dependent
          momentum equation for flow in the inlet and the continuity equation
          relating the bay and sea levels to inlet discharge.  The model is
          designed for cases where the bay water level fluctuates uniformly
          throughout the bay and the volume of water stored in the inlet
          between high and low water is negligible compared with the tidal
          prism of water that moves through the inlet and is stored in the
          bay.  The model has been previously described by Seelig (1977) and
          Seelig, Harris, and Herchenroder (1977).

                              SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


     ACES is designed to run on IBM PC-AT (or compatible) machines with 640 Kb
memory, a hard drive, and an 80287 math co-processor. The screen displays in
ACES are designed in color. A color adaptor and monitor ( EGA, PGA, or CGA) are
preferable. Some monochrome display adaptors and monitors will also work. A
printer is recommended, but not required.  ACES is distributed on one high
density diskette.
